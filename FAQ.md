**Pocket Verse - The Right Verse for Right Now**

---

## General

### What is Pocket Verse?
Pocket Verse is a mobile app that helps you find Bible verses that speak to your current feelings and situations. Simply describe what's on your heart, and we'll find a verse that offers comfort, guidance, or encouragement.

### How does it work?
You type in how you're feeling or what you're going through (e.g., "feeling anxious about a job interview"). Our AI analyzes your input and searches the entire Bible to find a verse that speaks to your situation.

### Which Bible translation do you use?
We draw from multiple well-known translations to find the verse that best fits your situation and reads clearly.

### Is this app affiliated with any church or denomination?
No. Pocket Verse is a non-denominational app designed to help anyone find comfort in scripture, regardless of their church background.

## Using the App

### How many verses can I get per day?
Free users can generate 1 verse per day. Premium subscribers have unlimited access.

### Why only 1 verse per day for free users?
We designed it this way to encourage meaningful, intentional reflection rather than casual browsing. Think of it as your daily moment with scripture.

### Can I get a different verse if the first one doesn't feel right?
Free users receive 1 verse per day. If you'd like to try again, you can upgrade to Premium for unlimited verses.

### What should I type in the prompt?
Be honest and specific about what you're feeling. For example:
- "I'm worried about my health"
- "Feeling lonely and disconnected"
- "Grateful but don't know how to express it"
- "Struggling to forgive someone"

The more genuine your input, the more relevant the verse will be.
