# Branding & Naming Decisions

## App Name

After discussion, the official working title for the application is **Pocket Verse**.

### Reasoning

*   **"Pocket"**: This word clearly communicates the app's primary value proposition: convenience, portability, and instant access to guidance.
*   **"Verse"**: This word is more accurate and approachable than the original "Psalm" or the more formal "Scripture." It's a commonly understood term that resonates with a broad Christian audience, from devout to casual.
*   **Combination**: "Pocket Verse" is memorable, descriptive, and feels friendly. It effectively balances the app's purpose with a modern, accessible feel, aligning well with the goal of achieving strong product-market fit.

### Previous Names Considered

*   **Psalm Finder:** The original name. Discarded because the app's scope expanded to include the entire Bible, not just the book of Psalms.
*   **Pocket Scripture:** A strong contender, but "Scripture" was deemed potentially too formal or academic for a broad, modern audience.
*   **Verse Guide:** A good, descriptive alternative, but "Pocket Verse" was chosen for its slightly more personal and convenient feel.
*   **Faithful Verse, Verseful, The Verse App:** Other alternatives that were considered during the brainstorming process.
